* A collection of games for parity game and energy game solvers

** Parity games

We rely on the yearly competition SYNTCOMP24 for our benchmarks, which has a
competition track for parity game solvers, and on the benchmark suite of
Keiren[fn:1].  

We subdivide the approximately 1000 benchmarks into two categories: synthetic
games (crafted by researchers, usually with the intent of being hard for certain
parity game solving approaches) and organic games (the natural counterpart of
the synthetic games).  We note that the synthetic games include the ``two
counter games'' examples, in which Tangle Learning and Recursive Tangle Learning
show an exponential behaviour. It also contains the family of examples by
Friedmann[fn:2], exponential for Optimal Strategy Improvement.  The organic
games are essentially the ones provided by Keiren[fn:1], see therein for their
origin.

** Energy games

We do not provide energy games in this repository, as they amount to more than 50GB of data.

A script is provided to generate all the benchmarks, if desired.  These games
are randomly generated, but the random generator seed is fixed, so the files
produced will be exactly the same for everyone.

To generate the missing energy games, run:

#+begin_src shell
  $ cd ~/src/game-benchmarks/tools
  $ make                           # This will take about 5 minutes
  g++ -std=c++20 -Wall -O3 -march=native random-game-generator.cc  -lm -lmpfr -lgmp   -o random-game-generator
  $ cd ../energy-games
  $ ./generate-energy-games.sh     # This will take about 30 minutes and generate 50 GB of games
#+end_src
